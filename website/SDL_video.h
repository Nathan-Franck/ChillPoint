 *  example, one might have a borderless window that wants to be draggable
 *  from any part, or simulate its own title bar, etc.
 *
 *  This function lets the app provide a callback that designates pieces of
 *  a given window as special. This callback is run during event processing
 *  if we need to tell the OS to treat a region of the window specially; the
 *  use of this callback is known as "hit testing."
 *
 *  Mouse input may not be delivered to your application if it is within
 *  a special area; the OS will often apply that input to moving the window or
 *  resizing the window and not deliver it to the application.
 *
 *  Specifying NULL for a callback disables hit-testing. Hit-testing is
 *  disabled by default.
 *
 *  Platforms that don't support this functionality will return -1
 *  unconditionally, even if you're attempting to disable hit-testing.
 *
 *  Your callback may fire at any time, and its firing does not indicate any
 *  specific behavior (for example, on Windows, this certainly might fire
 *  when the OS is deciding whether to drag your window, but it fires for lots
 *  of other reasons, too, some unrelated to anything you probably care about
 *  _and when the mouse isn't actually at the location it is testing_).
 *  Since this can fire at any time, you should try to keep your callback
 *  efficient, devoid of allocations, etc.

 *  \param window The window to set hit-testing on.
